# VRC2020
## Vex robotics code for the 2019 to 2020 competition
This is the code I worked on in the Vex Robotics Room at Queen Elizabeth's school for the 2019 to 2020 season of the Vex Robotics competition. The code was all programmed at either VRC Competitions or in TY5 at QE. 
avaliable links to demos of this code:

the project involved iterative testing on code to program a vex robot to A) respond with the VEX EDR controller and B) Complete the autonomous routine 
the code has been worked on and tuned since october 2020 with the earliest evidence of this code running avaliable is here from the 2019 Stowe Buckingham Regional in December: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13K4C6IwXIQ0PjLwmRi_32r88gwqjBDlG/view?usp=sharing
